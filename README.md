# WaveFileFromScratch
ðŸ”ˆ This is an basic implementation of a wave file handler for Mac OS (XCode).

This simply creates a wave file with fixed frequency and duration.

# Compiling the code
ðŸ–¥ If you download this repo just compile:
- main.c
- wave.h
- wave.c

ðŸ—’ You don't really need to use XCode.

# Sources
ðŸ“š This code was inspired by Richard Boulanger (ed.), Victor Lazzarini (ed.), Max Mathews (fo - The Audio Programming Book (2010, The MIT Press).
